## What is this?

{**WIP**} *Foundation* is a collection of extensions for some *Foundation* framework and *Swift Standard Library* types. They can be used on your project (like I do) to minimize boilerplate code or provide helpers.

All extensions are based on the {**WIP**} *Core* namespacing approach. You can know more about it [here](docs/WIPCore.md).
