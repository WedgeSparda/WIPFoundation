# {WIP} Extensions

## What is this?

{**WIP**} *Extensions* is a collection of extensions for some *Foundation* framework and *Swift Standard Library* types. 

## How to use?

First import the framework with

```swift
import WIPFoundation
```

Then, if the type is compatible with {**WIP**} *Extensions*, use the `wip` namespace to access the available functions and/or variables. 

For example:

```swift
var value: String = "Hello World!"
value.wip.hasLetters // true
```

Check the source code to see documented comments for each extension.
